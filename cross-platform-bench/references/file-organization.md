# File Organization

## Single Bench Layout

Use this for one benchmark program:

```text
.
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── CMakePresets.json
├── include/<bench_name>/
├── src/
│   ├── main.cpp
│   ├── suite_main.cpp
│   └── <bench_logic>.cpp
└── tests/
```

Do not add multi-bench manifests or registry directories for a single-bench task unless the generated project already provides them.

## Multi Bench Layout

Use this for multiple relatively independent measurements that should share one runner:

```text
src/
├── bench_manifest.cmake
├── suite_main.cpp
├── <generated-registry>/
├── fixtures/
├── support/
├── instr_tp/
├── mem_latency/
└── cache_probe/
```

`bench_manifest.cmake` is the source-of-truth list of bench directories:

```cmake
set(PROJECT_BENCHES
  instr_tp
  mem_latency
)
```

The generated registry support should rely on `sbench/register.hpp` so a bench leaf can build both as a split executable and as part of a singleton suite. When multiple leaves belong to one benchmark domain, prefer a domain suite that hides leaf registrations behind a domain-local factory; read `sbench-registration.md` for the C++ pattern.

## Bench Leaf Layout

Keep reusable logic separate from CLI registration:

```text
src/<bench_name>/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── include/<bench_name>/<bench_name>.hpp
├── src/main.cpp
├── src/<bench_name>.cpp
├── tests/test_smoke.cpp
└── docs/README.md
```

Tests should link the support/static logic library where possible, not the CLI entrypoint.

## Fixture And Support Separation

Use shared `fixtures/` or `support/` code for platform, scheduler, affinity, output sink, JSONL writer, setup/teardown, and probe helpers that several bench leaves genuinely share.

Keep each bench leaf's CLI options, setup parameters, measurement loop, result schema, validation rules, and mutable state local to that leaf. A fixture should provide capabilities, not know the business meaning of a specific bench. Bench leaves should not include each other's implementation files.

Treat parameter sweeps of one measurement as one bench. Split into separate leaves when tests have different setup, CLI shape, inner loop, or result fields.

## AI And Scratch Directories

When creating or extending a benchmark project, keep AI-facing project knowledge under `.ai/` and local scratch under `.dev/`:

```text
.
├── .ai/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── plan/
│   ├── status/
│   ├── decisions/
│   └── notes/
└── .dev/
```

- `.ai/README.md`: committed AI index for the project. Link to architecture notes, build/test guidance, plans, status, decisions, benchmark conventions, and generated-template notes.
- `.ai/plan/`: committed plans for multi-step project work, migrations, benchmark additions, or xbundle integration.
- `.ai/status/`: committed current state and handoff/resume notes that future agents need. Keep it concise; do not use it as a raw log directory.
- `.ai/decisions/`: committed design decisions, tradeoffs, and durable rationale.
- `.ai/notes/`: committed AI-facing research notes or project-specific conventions that do not fit the other folders.
- `.dev/`: ignored local scratch space for temporary scripts, generated artifacts, logs, experiments, downloads, and bulky outputs.

Put AI-generated files that should survive handoff under `.ai/`. Use `.ai/status/` for handoff state, and put disposable files under `.dev/`.

Recommend ignoring local-only scratch:

```gitignore
/.dev/
```

Do not ignore `.ai/`; it is project documentation.
